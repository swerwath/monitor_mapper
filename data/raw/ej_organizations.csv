Efforts will focus on chromium plating and anodizing plants.  Air monitoring results will be analyzed to assess for toxic emissions from chromium plating and anodizing plants. The Compton area has several potential chrome-emitting facilities in the community in close proximity to each other and to schools, homes, other businesses and other sensitive receptors such as hospitals and senior centers. While the facilities are not known to be emitting high levels of hexavalent chromium, air monitoring using the latest technology will confirm whether or not they could pose a significant health risk to the community. The monitoring is expected to take several months."
